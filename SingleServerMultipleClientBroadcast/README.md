# About
This a small program that a client can send messages to clients with a server in between them. 

The function of the server is that when a client supposes Client A sends a message to the server, the server should forward that message to the other clients. 

Same way when the Client B sends a message to the server it should be forwarded to the other.

# Feature
Note that the client can only receives message after sending message, this might can be solved by using `asynchronous mode`.
